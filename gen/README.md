Submodules containing code generated by `genbindings` together with the `libseaqt` runtime.

When rebasing `seaqt` against upstream, the generated files are re-created as well so
as to provide a diff view of what each commit brings.

Users of `seaqt` can simply check out the appropriate branch without history, though
future releases of `seaqt` might revise this strategy.
